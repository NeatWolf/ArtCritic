You arrive at an art opening attended by a number of people of higher social status than you. You want to impress them by saying the right things about the art on display, but you know nothing about art.

The other attendees circulate around the room and occasionally give their opinion about an artwork. You can move around too, by clicking on the location you want to move to. If you are close enough to someone, you can catch what they're saying, and will be able to parrot it later.

But be careful! If you repeat what they said straight back to them, they will disdain you as an obvious sycophant. Also, watch the reactions of others carefully: not everyone has the same opinion, and it's only people of a higher social status (as indicated by the bar below them) who can improve your social status with their approval.

If you manage to say all the right things at the right time, everyone will be in awe of your astute taste in art. But if you carelessly reveal your lack of knowledge, you will be tossed out.

There is one more wrinkle: occasionally, one of the other visitors will ask your opinion about a piece of art. If you don't respond promptly, your reputation will suffer. The only other option is to down your glass of champagne and head off to find another one, exiting the situation before it becomes too awkward. Unfortunately, after a few glasses, you may be less than perfectly in control of your actions...
